Ques- You are given n days and an array of size n denoting proce of sa stochk on ith day. Calculate maximum profit that can
be earned if multiple transactions are allowed but two transactions cannot overlap each other. (BSBS)buy sell buy sell this 
should be followed;
and when you sell a stock a fine will be charged.

int n;
cin>>n;
int *prices=new int[n];
for(int i=0;i<n;i++)){
cin>>prices[i];

}
int fine;
cin>>fine;


int obp=-arr[0];
int osp=0;

for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
int nbp=0;
int nsp=0;
if(osp-prices[i]>obp)
nbp=osp-prices[i];
else
nbp=obp;

if(obp+prices[i]-fine>osp){
nsp=obp+prices[i]-fine;

}
else{
nsp=osp;

}
osp=nsp;
obp=nbp;

}

int ans= osp;

cout<<ans<<end;
