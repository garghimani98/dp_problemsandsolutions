find number of ways to pair n friends if they can either stay single or pair up with others.

f(n)=f(n-1)+((n-1)*f(n-2));

f(n-1)-It means first friend will stay single so brings us the answer of n-1 friends

f(n-2)- It means first friend will pair up with all the other friends so left people will
 be n-2 so it will get us the answer of n-2 friends


dp[n+1];
dp[0]=0;
dp[1]=1;
dp[2]=2;
dp[3]=4;

for(int i=4;i<=n;i++){

dp[i]=dp[i-1]+(dp[i-2]*i-1);

}
