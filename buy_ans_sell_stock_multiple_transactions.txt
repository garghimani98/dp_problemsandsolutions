Ques You are given n days and an array of size n denoting proce of sa stochk on ith day. Calculate maximum profit that can

int bd,sd=0;// take buying and selling day  to be same initially.
int profit =0;


int n;
cin<<n;

int *prices=new int[n];
for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
cin<<prices[i];
}

for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
 if(arr[i]>arr[i-1]){
   sd++;
 }
 else
 {
  profit+=arr[sd]-arr[bd];
  sd=bd=i;
 }
profit+=arr[sd]-arr[bd];//to collect last waala
}

cout<<profit;
